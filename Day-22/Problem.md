# Task Question

You have been asked to clone an unused Git repository that the DevOps team  
created last week.  
Use the **natasha** account on the Storage Server (`ststor01`) in Stratos DC  
and fulfil the following requirements:

1. Clone `/opt/media.git` into `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos`.  
2. Perform the clone **without sudo** and **without changing any permissions**  
   or making unauthorised alterations to existing directories.  
3. Verify that the cloned repository is on branch `master`, has no commits,  
   and is ready for the Nautilus development team to use.

Which single `git clone` command accomplishes the task, and how do you confirm  
success while respecting the above constraints?
